# PlugHub.Shared.Mock

This is the **shared contract library** for the PlugHub.Plugin.Mock test plugin.

PlugHub.Shared.Mock defines interfaces and data structures used by PlugHub.Plugin.Mock, providing a clear contract for communication between the plugin and the host application. It serves as an example of how to structure shared components within the PlugHub ecosystem.
